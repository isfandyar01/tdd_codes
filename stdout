You get this message when you write code that is not yet exercised by
your current test cases.

The coverage report below may show

 * "LINE NEVER EXECUTED" 
 * "BRANCH NEVER TAKEN IN PREVIOUS CONDITIONAL"

Delete (or comment out) the code that is not yet needed.

Try to avoid getting this message by doing TDD!
  Work in small steps
  Write a test
  Watch it fail (maybe due to build errors)
  Make it pass with the simplest implementation
  Continue

See the exercise hints
